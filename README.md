Story Pitch

My first year of college, a guy that lived in the same residency as me caught my full attention. I was smitten. He had completely changed my views on love and marriage. I felt happier with him. When we broke up, I questioned the importance of marriage. Marriage is typically a formal long-term commitment between people. A theme that we are visualizing in this project is marriage/happiness. The question we are asking here is whether marriage and happiness are correlated. According to Pew Research Center, the percentage of people who are married has dropped more than 50% since the 1960s. This is a phenomenon that affects not only people who are of marrying age, but also people who are already married as it can affect families, as well as future generations by setting a precedence. It’s possible that the decline in marriages is due to commitment, financial challenges, etc. Also, in the Millennial generation, since there was globalization, economic disruption and technical change, it changed their mindsets about marriage compared to their parents. For example, after the pandemic, marriage rate has decreased and divorce rate increased. According to most U.S. adults who were looking for a relationship during the pandemic, they said it was harder than it was before which lowered the marriage rate. At the same time, divorce rate has been increasing because of financial challenges for most of the reason. On the other hand, there are important reasons why marriage can have positive effects on people’s health mentally and physically. To feel loved, trusted, and cared for made me feel safe and secure, and I would hope that marriage would amplify that. Marriage is a topic that someone would care about because it deals with the fundamental life issues such as love and health. As our social lives have changed after COVID-19, socialization and building relationships is something that we don’t take for granted as much anymore. Relationships are something that we should care about because it’s a key to happiness and a fulfilling life. This is because there are many positives that relationships can bring to people such as helping each other out or being there for each other. As a person who may be looking for a romantic relationship, and hopefully marriage someday, I would want more information on making such a decision.

Finding data

https://ourworldindata.org/marriages-and-divorces#marriages-are-becoming-less-common

This dataset collected information from each country via the United Nation Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ public data for World Marriage and Population Division. The UN collected such information mostly through different national surveys including the census, but there are also a few estimations. The dataset we’re using used that information to calculate crude marriage rates of different countries with respect to time. It contains four columns: entity (country), code (abbreviation of entity), year, and crude marriage rate (for every 1,000 inhabitants). There are 3252 rows (multiple rows represent a single nation).

This dataset contains information that is notably reported from The World Happiness Report, which produces happiness scores based on data from Gallup World Poll surveys. People are asked to rate their lives on a scale of 0 to 10 for things like perceptions of corruption and social support. The sample size is around 1,000 for each country each year, but data from previous years are used for a sample size of 3,000 to minimize sampling errors. The number of columns is four: country, changes in happiness scores, whisker-high, and whisker-low. There are 127 rows.
